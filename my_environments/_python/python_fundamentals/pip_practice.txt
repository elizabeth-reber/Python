PIP is a recursive acronym that stands for “PIP Installs Packages” or “Preferred Installer Program”. It’s a command-line utility that allows you to install, reinstall, or uninstall 
PyPI packages with a simple and straightforward command: pip.  You can control where packages are installed depending on whether or not you are using a virtual environment.  If not 
using a vEnv then the package is stored in a default location on your local machine.

pip install Django==1.11.9
Installs the Django package

pip list
This comand returns a list of all the packages installed

deactivate 
This will deactivate your virtual environment

pip3 list
Pip3 is a version of the pip installer for python3, which can download and configure new python modules with a simple one line command like… Pip3 relies on PyPI (the Python Package Index) 
which is a software repository where versions of community-managed modules are maintained.

source myEnvironments/py3Env/bin/activate
This supposedly activates the virtual environment, but it does not work as such on my pc.  I have to use source py3Env/Scripts/activate to get my vEnv to turn on.

pip freeze
You can see all of the modules that have been installed using the pip install command on my windows command prompt and the versions of those modules.  I wanted to know how pip freeze and 
pip list are different.  there are two differences: Output format, freeze gives us the standard requirement format that may be used later with pip install -r to install requirements from. 
Output content, pip list include editables which pip freeze does not.
