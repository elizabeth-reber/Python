Create 5 books with the following names: C Sharp, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby
C_Sharp = Books.objects.create(title = "C Sharp", description = "cool book")
Java = Books.objects.create(title = "Java", description = "cool book")
Python = Books.objects.create(title = "Python", description = "cool book")
PHP = Books.objects.create(title = "PHP", description = "cool book")

Create 5 different authors: Jane Austen, Emily Dickinson, Fyodor Dostoevksy, William Shakespeare, Lau Tzu

Emily_Dickinson = Authors.objects.create(first_name = "Emily", last_name = "Dickinson")
Fyodor_Dostoevksy = Authors.objects.create(first_name = "Fyodor", last_name = "Dostoevksy")
William_Shakespeare = Authors.objects.create(first_name = "William", last_name = "Shakespeare")

Add a new text field in the authors table called 'notes'.
I did this in the models file.

Create and run the migration files to update the table in your database.

Change the name of the C Sharp book to C#
c_update = Books.objects.get(title = "C Sharp")	
c_update.title = "C#"	
c_update.save()


Change the first name of the 4th author to Bill
b_author = Authors.objects.get(id = 4)	
b_author.first_name = "Bill"	
b_author.save()

Assign the first author to the first 2 books
first_author = Authors.objects.get(id=1)	
first_books = Books.objects.get(id=1)	
first_author.books.add(first_books)	  
second_books = Books.objects.get(id=2)
first_author.books.add(second_books)	

Assign the second author to the first 3 books
second_author = Authors.objects.get(id="2")	
first_book = Books.objects.get(id="1")
first_book.authors.add(second_author)
second_book = Books.objects.get(id="2")
second_book.authors.add(second_author)
third_book = Books.objects.get(id="3")
third_book = Books.objects.get(id="3")

Assign the third author to the first 4 books
third_author = Authors.objects.get(id="3")	
first_book = Books.objects.get(id="1")
first_book.authors.add(third_author)
second_book = Books.objects.get(id="2")
second_book.authors.add(third_author)
third_book = Books.objects.get(id="3")
third_book.authors.add(third_author)
fourth_book = Books.objects.get(id="4")
fourth_book.authors.add(third_author)

Assign the fourth author to the first 5 books (or in other words, all the books)
fourth_author = Authors.objects.get(id="4")	
first_book = Books.objects.get(id="1")
first_book.authors.add(fourth_author)
second_book = Books.objects.get(id="2")
second_book.authors.add(fourth_author)
third_book = Books.objects.get(id="3")
third_book.authors.add(fourth_author)
fourth_book = Books.objects.get(id="4")
fourth_book.authors.add(fourth_author)
fifth_book = Books.objects.get(id="5")
fifth_book.authors.add(fourth_author)

Retrieve all the authors for the 3rd book
third_book = Books.objects.get(id = 3)
third_book_authors = third_book.authors.all()

Remove the first author of the 3rd book
author_to_delete = Authors.objects.get(id=1)	
author_to_delete.delete()

Add the 5th author as one of the authors of the 2nd book
